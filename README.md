# Parse CSV with jQuery and JS

This is a task I took on at my job. We needed to display information from a CSV file and output it onto an internal webpage to display on a TV at the office. I can't share the whole page, but I can have the js file that does the parsing and creation of "cards" on my page.


## Running the tests

I've included a test csv so that you could see what happens if you pair it with an index.html and stylesheet.


## Built With

* [jQuery](https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.min.js)- The web framework used

## Contributing

This works with an AJAX request with mozilla even though it's not hosted, but if someone knows how to get this to work in chrome without changing settings, please email me @ pat.cranfill@gmail.com
